# How to access and use Feature Data via OGC API Features

## 1. Overview

In this open educational resource (OER) you will learn how to access and use OGC API Features with GIS application and with python. The first approach will be explained with QGIS, while the python tutorial will be elaborated with Jupyter Notebooks.

- We will use Docker to install and run Jupyter Notebooks on your local computer
- Use Python to access and extract Feature Data from INSPIRE Database(Protected Sites Data)
- Deep dive into the extracted features and understand the usecases in depth.

## 2. Content

The module is structured as follows

1. Overview on OGC API Features and OGC API REST Framework
2. Brief idea on what what INSPIRE and INSPIRE Feature Data are, how INSPIRE Download Services can be implemented
3. Installation of QGIS application and access of INSPIRE Feature Data for Protected Sites.
4. Installating and using Jupyter Notebooks for accessing and analyzing OGC API Feature Data
5. Exploratory data-analysis on the extracted feature data with Python libraries.
6. Wrap up

If you are mainly interested in the technical aspects, you can jump directly to chapter 3 where we guide you through the technical exercise. With the help of some self-assessments/exercises you can check if you have understood the essential concepts and technologies.

## 3. Learning Objectives

By the end of this OER, learners will be able to:

- Understand what INSPIRE and INSPIRE Feature Data are
- Implement INSPIRE Download Services
- Work with OGC API Features and the OGC API REST framework
- Use QGIS to access and analyze INSPIRE Feature Data(Protected Sites)
- Use Python to access INSPIRE Feature Data(Protected Sites)
- Gain clarity on the process to extract Feature Data and its use in Spatial Data studies
- Advantages of using OGC API Rest framework over classic web services.
- Apply these skills to a windfarm use case

## 4. Assessment

Learners will be assessed through their completion of the exercises included in this OER.
